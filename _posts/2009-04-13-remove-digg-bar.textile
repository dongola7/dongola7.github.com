title: Removing the Digg Bar
---

I really don't like the new Digg bar.  It's really more of a personal
preference than anything related to the potential link stealing and
what not.  As such, I wrote a quick Greasemonkey script to get rid
of the new Digg short URLs while browsing the site.  

Hopefully someone finds it helpful.
