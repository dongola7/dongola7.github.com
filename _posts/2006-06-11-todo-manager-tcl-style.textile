title: Todo Manager (Tcl Style)
---

"Lifehacker":http://lifehacker.com had an interesting post about keeping track 
of a Todo list in a simple "TXT file":http://www.lifehacker.com/software/to-do-managers/geek-to-live-readerwritten-todotxt-manager-173018.php.
They even went so far as to create a UNIX shell script for managing said file.  
I wanted to try it out at work, but we use Windows (not by choice), and I didn't
want to bother installing Cygwin.  I rewrote the script as a small Tcl program,
and posted it on "Google Code":http://code.google.com/p/blairkitchen/source/browse/todo/trunk/todo.tcl.
